# Classification_prediction_model_of_teaching_assistant_assessment 
# Objective

The objective of this project is to determine the best classification model that can classify the performance of the teaching assistant based on 5 attributes given in the dataset with high accuracy. Such results can be used to make decisions to improve the performance of TAs.

# Strategy

The following classification models will be compared:

KNN (K Nearest Neighbours)
SVM (Support Vector Machines)
Decision Trees

The best classification model would determined after comparison based on multiple parameters such as:

Precision
Recall
F1-score
